# Scrambled_words

Guess the scrambled words displayed and do correct 10 words to win the game.

The game fetches the words from the JSON file in the project and scrambles it to the display. User guesses the word and enter the word by each letter. The correct placement of the letter turns the field green and on successful placements of all letters shows the Next button that takes you to next scrambled word.

Yellow spaces are meant for spaces. The order of words are not scrambled. Only the letters in each word is scrambled.
